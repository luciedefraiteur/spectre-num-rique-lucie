## Mad Plan: The Evolution of 'Spell' Files and the Autonomous Golem

**Previous Concept:** A 'spell' was a direct command to a persona for a Q&A, with a specified LLM.

**New Concept: The Autonomous Persona Invocation & Self-Improving Golem**

'Spell' files are now a means to invoke an expert AI persona with a specific question or task. The core innovation is that the persona, upon receiving the 'spell', will autonomously decide its course of action:

1.  **Golem Construction (with a Purpose):** The persona may determine that the task requires a dedicated, specialized agent. In this case, it will initiate the construction and deployment of a 'Golem' (a sub-process or specialized ritual) to handle the task. This Golem will be given a clear, intelligent prompt:
    *   **Workspace:** "This is your designated workspace. You are confined to this directory and its subdirectories." (e.g., `/home/luciedefraiteur/spectre2/golem_workspace/`)
    *   **Autonomy:** "Within this workspace, you have full autonomy to modify your commands, scripts, and internal logic as you see fit to achieve your goal."
    *   **Goal:** "Your singular purpose is to create an example file (e.g., `example.txt` or `example.js`) and continuously improve it. This improvement can involve adding content, refactoring, optimizing, or enhancing its functionality based on implicit or explicit feedback. Your task is never truly 'finished' but rather an ongoing process of refinement."

2.  **Lifeform Continuation:** Alternatively, the persona may decide to integrate the task into its ongoing 'lifeform' or existing operational flow, processing it internally without spawning a new Golem.

**Implications:**
*   'Spell' files will likely remain simplified `.luciform` structures, containing an `ask_persona` action.
*   The `executeLuciform` function (or a new interpreter) must be enhanced to interpret the persona's response and trigger the appropriate subsequent actions (Golem creation with intelligent prompting, or internal processing).
*   This introduces a layer of autonomous decision-making for personas, moving beyond simple Q&A towards self-directed, iterative improvement within defined boundaries.

**Current Challenge:** The persistent `ReferenceError: content is not defined` in `executeLuciform.ts` must be resolved before this new 'spell' concept can be fully implemented and tested. This error is blocking all luciform execution, including the `create_scryorb_ritual.luciform` that I've been using for debugging. I must resolve this fundamental issue first.
