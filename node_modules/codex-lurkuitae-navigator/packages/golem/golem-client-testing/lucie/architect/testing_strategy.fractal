# Golem Client Testing Strategy

## Objective
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Golem client, ensuring robust interaction with the Golem server and the underlying LLM.

## Testing Areas
The testing will be divided into three main areas:
1.  **LLM Interaction:** Testing the client's ability to send requests to and receive responses from the LLM.
2.  **Server Interaction:** Testing the client's communication with the Golem server, including sending commands and receiving ritual steps.
3.  **Server + LLM Interaction:** End-to-end testing of the entire workflow, from the client to the server, to the LLM, and back.

## Test Cases
The following test cases will be implemented:

### LLM Interaction
- **Test Case 1.1: Simple Prompt:** Send a simple prompt to the LLM and verify that a valid response is received.
- **Test Case 1.2: Complex Prompt:** Send a complex, multi-turn prompt to the LLM and verify the conversational context is maintained.
- **Test Case 1.3: Error Handling:** Test the client's ability to handle errors from the LLM, such as invalid API keys or network issues.

### Server Interaction
- **Test Case 2.1: Connect to Server:** Verify that the client can successfully connect to the Golem server.
- **Test Case 2.2: Send Command:** Send a command to the server and verify that it is correctly interpreted.
- **Test Case 2.3: Receive Ritual Step:** Verify that the client can receive and process a ritual step from the server.
- **Test Case 2.4: Disconnect from Server:** Verify that the client can gracefully disconnect from the server.

### Server + LLM Interaction
- **Test Case 3.1: End-to-End Ritual Execution:** Initiate a ritual from the client, have the server execute it (which involves LLM interaction), and verify that the client receives the correct final output.
- **Test Case 3.2: Concurrent Rituals:** Test the system's ability to handle multiple concurrent rituals initiated from different clients.
