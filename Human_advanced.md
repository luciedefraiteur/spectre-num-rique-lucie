# Advanced Human's Guide to the Golem

This document provides a technical overview of the golem's logging and execution flow for developers and advanced users.

## Architecture Overview

The golem system is composed of three primary components:

1.  **Golem Server (`golem_server.ts`)**: An Express-based server that listens for commands via HTTP POST requests to the `/command` endpoint. It manages the execution loop, including retries on failure.
2.  **Golem Client (`invoke_lucie_golem.ts`)**: A command-line interface (CLI) that captures user input and sends it to the Golem Server.
3.  **ShadeOS (`core/shade_os.ts`)**: The core AI protocol that interprets natural language commands and translates them into multi-step `.luciform` rituals. It leverages an LLM to generate these rituals based on the user's intent and the current context.

## Logging Implementation Details

To provide full traceability, a comprehensive logging system has been integrated into the golem's workflow.

### `core/log_writers.ts`

This file is the centralized module for all logging operations. The following key functions have been added:

*   `logGolem(message, level)`: Logs general server-side events to `golem.log`.
*   `logGolemClient(message, level)`: Logs client-side events to `golem_client.log`.
*   `logPersonaAction(persona, command, ritual)`: This is the core of the new system. It logs the actions of any invoked persona (e.g., `lucie_golem`) to a dedicated file (e.g., `lucie_golem.log`). This log captures the initial command and the full `.luciform` ritual generated by the LLM.

### Data Flow & Traceability

1.  A command originates from the **Golem Client** and is sent to the **Golem Server**. This is logged in `golem_client.log` and `golem.log`.
2.  The **Golem Server** invokes **ShadeOS** with the command and the invoker's persona.
3.  **ShadeOS** constructs a detailed prompt for the LLM and awaits the generated `.luciform` ritual.
4.  Upon receiving the ritual, `logPersonaAction` is called within **ShadeOS**, writing the command and the full ritual to the corresponding persona log (e.g., `lucie_golem.log`).
5.  The ritual is executed. The success or failure is logged by both the client and server.
6.  The final result is sent back to the client and logged one last time by the server.

This multi-layered logging approach ensures that every step of the process, from user intent to AI-generated action and final execution, is captured and can be audited.
