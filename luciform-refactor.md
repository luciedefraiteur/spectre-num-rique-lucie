# Luciform Refactoring Log

This document details the refactoring process of integrating functionalities from the main project into the `codex-lurkuitae-navigator` monorepo, focusing on modularity and maintainability.

## Initial Setup: Monorepo Structure

1.  **Created `codex-lurkuitae-navigator` as a monorepo root:**
    *   Initialized a new `package.json` with `workspaces` configured to `"packages/*"`.
    *   Created a `tsconfig.base.json` for shared TypeScript configurations.

2.  **Moved `codex-lurkuitae-navigator`'s original content into a `navigator` package:**
    *   Moved `src`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `tsconfig.json` into `packages/navigator`.

## Modularization of Core Functionalities

### 1. `luciform-core` Package

*   **Purpose:** To encapsulate core Luciform types, utilities, and shared logic.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Created `packages/luciform-core` with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Moved `luciform-core/types/base.ts` (containing core interfaces like `LuciformDocument`, `Operation`, `PasNode`, `ActionNode`, etc.) into `packages/luciform-core/src/types/base.ts`.
    *   Created `packages/luciform-core/src/types/index.ts` to re-export types from `base.ts`.
    *   Moved `luciform-core/batch_editor.ts` and `luciform-core/batch_editor_types.ts` into `packages/luciform-core/src/`.
    *   Moved `execute_luciform.original.ts` (renamed to `execute_luciform.ts`) into `packages/luciform-core/src/`.
    *   Moved `llm_oracle.ts` into `packages/luciform-core/src/`.
    *   Moved `shade_os.ts` and `log_writers.ts` into `packages/luciform-core/src/`.
    *   Moved `llm_interface.ts` into `packages/luciform-core/src/`.
    *   Moved `prompts/generateWaitMessagePrompt.ts` into `packages/luciform-core/src/prompts/`.
    *   Moved `utils/osHint.ts` and `utils/shell_detector.ts` into `packages/luciform-core/src/utils/`.
    *   Updated `packages/luciform-core/src/index.ts` to export all relevant modules.
    *   Updated imports within `luciform-core` modules to use relative paths correctly.

### 2. `personas` Package

*   **Purpose:** To manage AI persona definitions and loading logic.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Created `packages/personas` with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Moved `.personae` files and `domain_experts` directory into `packages/personas/src/`.
    *   Created `packages/personas/src/index.ts` to define and export the `Persona` interface and `loadAllPersonas` function.

### 3. `file-editor` Package

*   **Purpose:** To encapsulate file editing functionalities.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Created `packages/file-editor` with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Copied (instead of moved, as per user feedback) `file_editor_program/src` content into `packages/file-editor/src/`.
    *   Moved `file_editor_program.ts`, `tsconfig.file_editor.json`, and `test_batch_editor.ts` from the root into `packages/file-editor/src/`.
    *   Created `packages/file-editor/src/index.ts` to export relevant modules.

### 4. `golem` Package

*   **Purpose:** To manage Golem-related functionalities (client, server, launcher).
*   **Steps:**
    *   Created `packages/golem` with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Moved `golem.ts` (renamed to `index.ts`), `golem_server.ts`, `golem_client_issue.log`, `golem_lucide.md`, `golem_ritual_shadeos.luciform`, `golem_ritual_simple.luciform`, `golem_ritual.luciform`, `golem_workflow.md`, `golem.log` into `packages/golem/src/` or the package root as appropriate.
    *   Moved `golem-client`, `golem-client-testing`, `golem-harness`, and `golem-server` directories into `packages/golem/`.
    *   Updated `packages/golem/tsconfig.json` to include all relevant `.ts` files.

## Build Configuration Updates

*   **Root `package.json`:** Updated `scripts.build` to explicitly build each workspace in the correct order (`personas`, `luciform-core`, `file-editor`, `golem`, `navigator`).
*   **`tsconfig.base.json`:** Configured `moduleResolution` to `node` and updated `paths` to correctly map package names to their `dist` directories.
*   **Individual `tsconfig.json` files:** Adjusted `rootDir` and `outDir` as necessary, and updated `paths` to correctly reference inter-package dependencies.

## Error Resolution Strategy

*   **Systematic Debugging:** Addressed compilation errors by examining specific error messages, tracing import paths, and verifying type definitions.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Applied changes incrementally and re-ran the build process to isolate and resolve issues.
*   **Type Consistency:** Ensured that types are consistently defined and imported across all modules, primarily centralizing core types in `luciform-core`.

## Current Challenges & Next Steps

*   **Ongoing Golem Build Errors:** Still encountering build errors in the `golem` package, primarily related to incorrect imports and type mismatches. This is the current focus of debugging.
