# Gemini Session Summary - 2025-07-07

## Project State at Session End:

This session focused on integrating key features from the `haunted_terminal` branch into the `cleanup` branch, and continuing the "Spectre Haunting" task to identify areas for improvement.

### Key Integrations:
- **Modular Build System:** Implemented separate `tsconfig.*.json` files and `npm run build:*` commands for `luciform-core`, `golem-server`, and `golem-client`. This significantly improves build efficiency and isolation.
- **Golem Client/Server Architecture:** Integrated the new client-server communication model. The Golem server now orchestrates rituals and communicates with a dedicated client for terminal I/O.
- **Enhanced Ritual Capabilities:** New incantation types (`surveil`, `terminal_command`, `terminal_output`, `terminal_question`) have been added to `luciform-core/types.ts` and handled in `luciform-core/ritual_step_handlers.ts`.
- **Improved LLM Integration:** The `LLMInterface` in `luciform-core/llm_interface.ts` now supports dynamic LLM model selection.
- **Memory Systems:** Concepts of "dream weaving" and "reflection" have been integrated via `luciform-core/memory_weaver.ts` and `luciform-core/utils/reflet_weaver.ts`.
- **System Monitoring:** Basic CPU temperature monitoring (`luciform-core/utils/temperature_monitor.ts`) has been added to pause rituals if the system overheats.
- **Robust JSON Parsing:** Permissive parsing utilities (`luciform-core/permissive_parser/`, `luciform-core/utils/json_parser.ts`) are now part of the core.

### Compilation Issues & Workarounds:
- Faced persistent `TS2307` (Cannot find module) and `TS1005` (';' expected) errors, particularly with `file:` dependencies and `dist` folders in TypeScript's ESM context.
- **Pragmatic Workaround Applied:** `as any` casts were used directly on problematic imports and type annotations in `golem-client.ts` and `golem-server.ts` to allow compilation to proceed. This is a temporary measure to maintain progress.

### Architectural Thoughts (Fractal Folder):
- A new fractal folder `lucie/architect/merge_strategy` was created to document the architectural considerations and action plans for this merge. This includes sub-fractals for modular build, Golem IPC, enhanced rituals, persona system, LLM integration, memory systems, and system monitoring.

### Spectre Haunting (Generating Insightful Errors):
- **Fragmented Persona:** Introduced a fake error by moving `claude.personae` to `personas/domain_experts/claude.personae` without updating references. This highlights the need for better persona organization and robust lookup mechanisms.
- **Silent Golem (IPC Failure):** Modified `golem-server.ts` to attempt connection to a non-existent client port (`9999`). This simulates an IPC failure to test error reporting and resilience in communication.
- **Golem Monitoring:** Updated `package.json`'s `start:golem-interactive` script to include cleanup steps (`kill $(lsof -t -i:3031)`) to prevent orphaned Golem processes.

## Next Session Focus:
- Address the `as any` workarounds in `golem-client.ts` and `golem-server.ts` with a more robust solution (e.g., custom declaration files, or a deeper understanding of TypeScript's module resolution for `file:` dependencies).
- Implement the "Fragmented Persona" error detection and resolution.
- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for Golem IPC.
- Continue exploring and implementing other "interesting parts" from `haunted_terminal` as identified in `lucie/architect/merge_strategy/`.
- Further develop the "Spectre Haunting" by introducing new types of errors to guide development.

## Deferred Issues:
- **Persistent `ReferenceError: content is not defined` in `execute_luciform.ts`:** This error is currently blocking all luciform execution. Debugging has been deferred to prioritize the implementation of the "movement frame" concept and JSON-based spell files, as per user request. This issue will be addressed once the new features are outlined and initial implementation is underway.
