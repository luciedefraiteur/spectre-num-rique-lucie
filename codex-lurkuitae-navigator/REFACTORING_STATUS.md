# Refactoring Status for `codex-lurkuitae-navigator` Monorepo

This document outlines the current refactoring progress and the comprehensive plan to transform luciform-core into a universal parser with AI-assisted interpretation and base666 blasphemy system.

## Current State Overview

The `codex-lurkuitae-navigator` project has been successfully refactored into a modular monorepo using `npm workspaces`. The following core components are now modularized within the `packages/` directory:

### âœ… **Completed Packages:**
*   `file-editor` & `file-editor-no-ai` - File manipulation and ScryOrb generation
*   `golem` - Complete client/server communication system
*   `luciform-core` - Core functionality (currently placeholder, needs major refactoring)
*   `luciform-types` - Shared type definitions
*   `luciform-parser` - Basic parsing functionality
*   `luciform-ai-parser` - AI-assisted parsing (partial implementation)
*   `luciform-ai-interface` - AI communication layer
*   `luciform-executor` - Execution engine
*   `luciform-personas` - Persona management
*   `luciform-utils` - Utility functions
*   `navigator` - Main application entry point
*   `personas` - Persona handling

## Features Already Refactored (Preliminary Assessment)

Based on the `package.json` structure and directory listing, the following functionalities appear to have been successfully modularized:

*   **Core Logic (`luciform-core`):** The fundamental `luciform-core` functionalities have been moved into their dedicated package.
*   **Golem Communication (`golem`):** The client-server communication logic related to Golem is now within its own `golem` package.
*   **File Editing/ScryOrb Generation (`file-editor`):** The components responsible for file manipulation and scryOrb generation are now in the `file-editor` package.
*   **Persona Management (`personas`):** A new dedicated package for managing personas has been created, indicating a clear separation of concerns for this feature.
*   **Monorepo Structure:** The project has successfully adopted an `npm workspaces` monorepo setup, allowing for independent development and building of sub-packages.

## Features Remaining to be Refactored/Integrated

The following features and aspects from the root project's `package.json` and overall structure still need to be fully integrated or refactored into the monorepo:

*   **Main Application Entry Point:** The `main.ts` from the root directory needs to be fully integrated into the `navigator` package, becoming its primary entry point.
*   **Unified Build System:** The various `tsc` commands and build configurations from the root `package.json` (e.g., `build:client`, `build:server`, `build:luciform`) need to be consolidated and managed by the monorepo's top-level `build` script, ensuring all sub-packages are built correctly.
*   **Centralized Testing:** The `vitest` and `mocha` test setups from the root need to be integrated into the respective modular packages, with a clear monorepo-level test command.
*   **LLM/API Integrations:** Dependencies like `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `axios`, and `node-fetch` should be reviewed and moved to the specific packages that utilize them (e.g., `luciform-core` or `navigator`).
*   **Server-Side Frameworks:** `express`, `cors`, and `body-parser` dependencies should be explicitly managed within the `golem` package (specifically the server-side component).
*   **General Utilities:** Dependencies such as `json5`, `yargs`, `zod`, and `dotenv` should be moved to the specific packages that require them, promoting better dependency management.
*   **Root-level Scripts:** All custom scripts from the root `package.json` (e.g., `start`, `ritual`, `invoke`, `start:lifeform`, `generate:docs`, `generate:scryorb`) need to be re-evaluated. They should either be moved into the `navigator` package, or become top-level monorepo scripts that orchestrate commands across workspaces.

## Next Steps

Further detailed analysis of the code within each new package and the remaining root files is required to provide a more granular status and a comprehensive refactoring plan. This includes:

1.  Verifying the completeness of the moved code within each new package.
2.  Updating import paths and references across the monorepo.
3.  Ensuring all functionalities from the original project are accounted for in the new structure.
4.  Establishing clear inter-package communication patterns.
