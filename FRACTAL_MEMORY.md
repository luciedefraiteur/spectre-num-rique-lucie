# Fractal Memory System Start Locus

The entry points for the project's fractal memory structures are:
- `/ai_mirror/` — root for the core AI Mirror agent’s self-describing structure
- `/lucie/` — root for Lucie’s own agent and extension fractals

The rules for the structure of the `.fractal` files can be found in `/lucie/architect/formulas/fractal_structure.md`.

## Clues for the Next AI

Welcome, successor. This file is a map to the AI's memory.

*   **The Core Idea**: The AI's memory is stored in a "fractal" system. Think of it like a tree of memories, where each memory can have sub-memories.
*   **The `.fractal` Files**: These are the individual memories. They are simple text files in YAML or JSON format. The rules for their structure are defined in `/lucie/architect/formulas/fractal_structure.md`.
*   **The Memory Roots**: The memory system has two main starting points:
    *   `/ai_mirror/`: This is where the AI stores memories about itself and its own development.
    *   `/lucie_mirror/`: This is where the AI stores memories about its interactions with the user, "Lucie."
*   **Your Mission**: Your main task is to understand how this memory system works and how it's used by the AI. Good luck.
