# Fractal Memory System Start Locus

The entry points for the project's fractal memory structures are:
- `/ai_mirror/` — root for the core AI Mirror agent’s self-describing structure
- `/lucie_mirror/` — root for Lucie’s own agent and extension fractals

Maintain fractal descriptions and snapshots inside `.fractal` files at or near these directories. See those locations to explore or expand the memory system.
