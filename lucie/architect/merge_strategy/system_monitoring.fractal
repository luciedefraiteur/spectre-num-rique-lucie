  **Concept:** System Temperature Monitoring.
  **Description:** `temperature_monitor.ts` and `temperature_sensor.ts` are added to check CPU temperature and pause rituals if the system overheats, ensuring system stability.
  **Action Plan:**
  - Merge `luciform-core/utils/temperature_monitor.ts` and `luciform-core/utils/temperature_sensor.ts`.
  - Integrate temperature checks into the ritual execution flow, particularly in `luciform-core/run_terminal_rituel.ts`.
  - Test the system's response to simulated high temperatures.
