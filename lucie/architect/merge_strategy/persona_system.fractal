  **Concept:** Improved Persona Loading and Interaction.
  **Description:** The `getPersonaResponse` function in `personas.ts` is enhanced to handle structured personas with job prompts and LLM model specifications, allowing for more dynamic persona interactions.
  **Action Plan:**
  - Merge changes from `luciform-core/personas.ts` to incorporate the new persona loading logic.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing persona files and the new `claude.personae` example.
  - Verify that persona interactions within rituals function as expected.
