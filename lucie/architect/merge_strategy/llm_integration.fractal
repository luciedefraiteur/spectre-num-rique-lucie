  **Concept:** Dynamic LLM Model Selection.
  **Description:** The `LLMInterface` now supports selecting different LLM models (Claude, Gemini, CodeLlama, Llama3, Mistral, OpenAI) and includes a random selection option.
  **Action Plan:**
  - Merge changes from `luciform-core/llm_interface.ts`.
  - Ensure all LLM API keys are correctly configured in the `.env` file.
  - Test LLM interactions with various models to confirm functionality.
