  **Concept:** Dream Weaving and Reflection Memory Systems.
  **Description:** The `memory_weaver.ts` and `reflet_weaver.ts` introduce concepts of "dream weaving" and "reflection" for generating poetic summaries and insights from ritual execution, and storing them in a fractal memory structure.
  **Action Plan:**
  - Merge `luciform-core/memory_weaver.ts`, `luciform-core/utils/dream_parser.ts`, `luciform-core/utils/dream_weaver.ts`, and `luciform-core/utils/reflet_weaver.ts`.
  - Ensure the fractal memory structure (`lucie/` and `lucie_reflet/` directories) is correctly initialized and utilized.
  - Verify that insights and reflections are generated and stored as expected.
