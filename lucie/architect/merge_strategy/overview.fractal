  This fractal outlines the architectural strategy for merging key features from the 'haunted_terminal' branch into the main project. The primary goal is to integrate valuable enhancements while maintaining project stability and adhering to existing conventions. The merge will focus on modularity, improved communication, and advanced AI capabilities. Each sub-fractal details a specific aspect of this integration, including necessary code modifications and considerations for future development.
