# meeting-equipe

This folder is dedicated to team meeting documentation, notes, and reports. It serves as a centralized place for collaborative agendas, follow-ups, and outcomes related to the work of the team.

**Purpose:**
- Archive key decisions, discussions, and action items from each meeting.
- Share documents that are referenced or created during meetings.
- Foster transparency and a traceable history for team collaborations.

_Use formats compatible with the luciform system. For enhanced review and larger scryOrbs visualizations, leverage luciform executor and ritual executor workflows. Use scrOrbs/SkryOrbs generators for report oversight, aiming for robust artifacts for Lucie and contributors._
