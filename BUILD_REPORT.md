# Build Report: Modular Compilation for Golem Project

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of separate build commands for the Golem project's client, server, and luciform parser/executor components. This modular approach enhances development efficiency by allowing independent compilation and reduces the complexity of the main build process.

## Rationale
Previously, a single `golem-build` script attempted to compile all Golem-related TypeScript files. This led to:
- **Compilation Conflicts:** Persistent `TS1259` and `TS2339` errors due to complex interactions between CommonJS modules (like `express`, `cors`, `body-parser`) and the ES module environment, despite `esModuleInterop` settings.
- **Debugging Difficulty:** Pinpointing the source of errors was challenging in a monolithic compilation.
- **Inefficient Builds:** Changes in one component required recompiling unrelated parts.

By separating the build processes, we aim to:
- **Isolate Compilation Issues:** Errors will be confined to specific components, simplifying debugging.
- **Improve Build Times:** Only affected components need recompilation.
- **Enhance Modularity:** Reinforce the architectural separation of concerns.

## Implementation
Three new `tsconfig.*.json` files have been created, each tailored for a specific component:
- `tsconfig.client.json`: For the Golem CLI client (`golem_client.ts`).
- `tsconfig.server.json`: For the Golem HTTP server (`golem_server.ts`).
- `tsconfig.luciform.json`: For the luciform parser/executor (`execute_luciform.ts`).

Each `tsconfig.*.json` extends the base `tsconfig.json` and specifies its `outDir` and `include`/`exclude` patterns to ensure only relevant files are compiled.

## New Build Commands
The `package.json` has been updated with the following new scripts:

- `npm run build:client`
  ```bash
  tsc --project tsconfig.client.json
  ```
  **Purpose:** Compiles `golem_client.ts` and its dependencies into `dist/client/`.

- `npm run build:server`
  ```bash
  tsc --project tsconfig.server.json
  ```
  **Purpose:** Compiles `golem_server.ts` and its dependencies into `dist/server/`.

- `npm run build:luciform`
  ```bash
  tsc --project tsconfig.luciform.json
  ```
  **Purpose:** Compiles `execute_luciform.ts` and its dependencies into `dist/luciform/`.

## Usage
To build individual components, use the respective `npm run build:*` command. For a full project build, these commands can be chained or run in parallel.

## Next Steps
With separate compilation, debugging of module-related issues should be significantly easier. The next phase involves testing each component independently and then integrating them to verify the full interactive Golem functionality.
