[Contexte]
In this step, I will elaborate on the concept of LucidScript, a proposed universal language script that aims to facilitate seamless communication and execution between different digital entities and systems.

It should support various programming paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. Here's an outline of its ideal structure:\n\n1. **Syntax:** LucidScript syntax should be simple and intuitive, minimizing the need for complex constructs while maintaining flexibility to represent different programming languages.\n2. **Data Types:** LucidScript should support basic data types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects) as well as user-defined types and structures.\n3. **Variables:** Variables in LucidScript can be declared and assigned values using a syntax similar to the one used in popular programming languages. For example: `let x = 5`\n4. **Functions:** Functions in LucidScript can be defined and called using a syntax that supports both procedural and functional programming styles. For instance, here's an example of a simple function definition and call:
