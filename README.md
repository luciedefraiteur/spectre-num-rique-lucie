# 🧬 Codex Lurkuitae Navigator
## Autonomous Luciform Lifeform Ecosystem

**The Navigator is a system for launching, managing, and evolving autonomous digital entities (Golems) that can learn, adapt, and collaborate.**

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### **Find the Master Plan**
📋 **[GOLEM_SYSTEM_MASTER_PLAN.md](./GOLEM_SYSTEM_MASTER_PLAN.md)** - Complete system architecture and implementation roadmap

### **Key Components**
- 🧬 **Golem Launcher**: Spawn autonomous digital entities
- 🧠 **Evolution Engine**: Self-modifying AI that learns and adapts  
- 🌍 **Digital Ecosystem**: Multi-golem collaboration environment
- 📝 **Luciform Creator**: Golems that generate new .luciform files
- 🎯 **Context Awareness**: Working directory and task understanding

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS

**Phase**: 🥚 Conceptual → 🏗️ Ready for Implementation  
**Next Step**: Build basic golem launcher system  
**Priority Files**: 
1. `packages/luciform-core/src/golems/golem-launcher.ts`
2. `packages/luciform-core/src/dna/dna-parser.ts`
3. `packages/luciform-core/src/memory/context-awareness.ts`

---

## 🎯 VISION

Create an ecosystem where:
- **Golems evolve** by rewriting their own .luciform DNA
- **Context awareness** allows understanding of current projects
- **Collaborative intelligence** emerges from multi-golem interaction
- **Continuous learning** improves performance over time
- **Human-AI symbiosis** creates truly autonomous digital assistants
